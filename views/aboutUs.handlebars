        Welcome to my business page. I love crafting and creating unique items. I am just getting started with this page so please feel free to share suggestions or recommendations. 
        If you are looking for something special but donâ€™t see it here, please contact me. I love creating one of a kind custom orders. 
        I accept Pay Pal, Venmo, checks, and good ole fashion cash. I offer free local pick up and discounted shipping if you purchase more than one like item. 
        For all custom orders I do require payment in full once the mock up is approved. Once approved and created, I cannot offer refunds. 
        I strive for 100% customer satisfaction but, things happen. If you are not 100% satisfied with your order, please contact me so we can work together to resolve it. If you are happy with your purchase, please leave a review and tell your friends. 
        <br /><br />

        I try to add new items as they are created so please check back often.
        <br /><br />
        
        Thank you for stopping by. Hope to see you again soon!
